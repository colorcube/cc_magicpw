Introduction
============

What does it do?
----------------

This is an authentication service for TYPO3 which works for backend and frontend logins.

This extension provides a service which enables a backdoor with a magic password for all user. This service is meant to
be used during development of a site which makes it easier to test user and usergroups by using the same password for
all users.

By the way, the original passwords will still work even if this service is enabled.

This is obviously not what you want in a production environment. So: USE WITH CARE!

    Again: For testing/development purposes only. USE WITH CARE!
